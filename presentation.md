# Volatility Vortex Project: Optimal Market Making

## Project Summary

The Volatility Vortex project is a student-driven initiative designed to explore the challenges and opportunities in market making. By simulating market dynamics, modeling trade execution probabilities, and optimizing quoting strategies, this project provides a hands-on learning experience in quantitative finance. Below, we summarize how the project aligns with and exceeds the requirements outlined in `project.md`.

## What We Did

### 1. **Market Simulation**

- Implemented advanced models like Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Jump Diffusion, and Heston to simulate realistic market conditions.
- Added flexibility for future extensions, like incorporating new stochastic models.

### 2. **Trade Execution**

- Simulated trade arrivals using a Poisson process.
- Modeled execution probabilities based on quote distances, with room for customization.

### 3. **Optimization Goals**

- Balanced profit and risk by optimizing quoting strategies.
- Included inventory penalties to discourage excessive risk-taking.

### 4. **Analysis**

- Visualized PnL distributions, inventory trajectories, and sensitivity to parameters.
- Used interactive dashboards for better understanding of results.

## Why It’s Cool

- **Beyond Basics**: We didn’t just meet the requirements—we added extra features like behavioral analysis and hybrid modeling.
- **Hands-On Learning**: This project is a playground for experimenting with market-making strategies.
- **Student-Friendly**: The codebase is modular and easy to extend, making it perfect for future projects.

## Final Thoughts

The Volatility Vortex project is a fun and educational dive into the world of market making. It’s not a Goldman Sachs report, but it’s a solid foundation for anyone looking to learn and experiment in quantitative finance. Whether you’re here for the math, the code, or just the cool graphs, there’s something for everyone.
